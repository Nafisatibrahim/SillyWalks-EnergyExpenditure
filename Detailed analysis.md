# Detailed Analysis of Energy Expenditure Across Walking Styles

## Results
### Energy Expenditure by Walking Style
Our analysis revealed significant variations in energy expenditure across the different walking styles. Below are some key findings illustrated with boxplots and statistical summaries:

- **Teabag Walk**: Exhibited the highest median energy expenditure and also showed the greatest variability. This suggests a higher energy cost, likely due to more physically exaggerated movements.
- **Usual Walk**: Had the least variability in energy expenditure, making it the most efficient walking style under study.
- **Putey Walk**: Displayed moderate energy expenditure, higher than the Usual Walk but significantly lower than the Teabag Walk.

### ANOVA Results
The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) highlighted highly significant differences among the walking styles:

- **F-value**: 672
- **p-value**: <0.0001

This indicates that the mean energy expenditures for each walking style are not equal, supporting our hypothesis that different walking styles incur different energy costs.

## Discussion
### Interpretation of Results
The findings from our statistical analyses suggest that walking styles that involve exaggerated movements (like the Teabag Walk) are less energy-efficient but may have other benefits or applications in physical therapy and performance arts. These styles could potentially be used to increase energy expenditure intentionally in a fitness context.

### Implications
These results have broad implications for understanding how everyday activities and deliberate changes in walking style can impact physical energy expenditure. They could be particularly useful for professionals in sports science, rehabilitation, and the performing arts.

### Limitations and Future Research
While the results are compelling, our study has limitations due to the dataset size and demographic diversity. Future research could expand on this by including a wider range of participants and exploring additional walking styles.

## Conclusion
This detailed examination of energy expenditure across different walking styles sheds light on how variations in movement can affect energy usage. Understanding these differences is crucial for fields such as physical therapy, sports science, and performance training.
