# SillyWalks-EnergyExpenditure
This repository contains a comprehensive statistical analysis of energy expenditure associated with various walking styles, inspired by Monty Python's "Ministry of Silly Walks". Utilizing data from a simulated experimental study, the project examines energy costs of three distinct walking styles: Usual Walk, Teabag Walk, and Putey Walk.

# Analysis of Energy Expenditure Across Different Walking Styles

## Project Overview
This repository contains the statistical analysis and findings from the final project for MATH 4650, which investigates the energy expenditure across three different walking styles inspired by Monty Python's "Ministry of Silly Walks". Utilizing side-by-side boxplots, ANOVA, and multiple linear regression, this project explores how different walking styles impact energy usage, influenced by factors such as BMI and gender.

## Motivation
The project is inspired by Monty Pythonâ€™s famous sketch and aims to quantify the energy expenditure of exaggerated walking styles. This analysis not only contributes to academic knowledge but also provides insights that might be useful in fields such as physical therapy, performance arts, and personal fitness.

## Files and Directories
- `WalkData4650.csv` - Dataset used for the analysis.
- `Final_Project_Stats.R` - R scripts for performing the statistical analysis.
- `Nafisat Ibrahim - Final Project - Statistics.pdf` - Comprehensive project report detailing methodology, analysis, and conclusions.
- `Analysis_Notebook.ipynb` (Optional) - Jupyter Notebook that provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the analysis.

## How to Run the Analysis
1. Ensure you have R and RStudio installed on your machine. Alternatively, use an R environment in Jupyter if you prefer.
2. Install the required R packages using the command:
   ```R
   install.packages("ggplot2")
   install.packages("reshape")
